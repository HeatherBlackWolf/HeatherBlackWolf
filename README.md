- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HeatherBlackWolf.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in writing a four book series, that may with or without 'luck' may become an eight part book series. I have been brainstorming, cutting out ideas, formulating
    new ideas, and have been constantly refining the plot for two years. The name of the series will be "Guardian". Each of the first three books will be from a different character's
    point of view, and the last will be from all three of them. 
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning chemistry, will be learning how to write better, and every kind of disgusting random piece of information that draws my interest.
