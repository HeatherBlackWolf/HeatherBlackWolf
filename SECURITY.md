are currently being supported with security updates. Currently Black-
bristle does not have a project in progress.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. Report
a vulnerability contacting Blackbristle on rmmrsc@outlook.com on email.


Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted
or declined, etc. Anyone reporting a vulnerability can expect to get an
update from Tuesdays to Saterdays. However updates may not be availible
for a few days or even weeks at a time. If the vulnerability is accepted
I will check out the problem as soon as I can, try my best to resolve it,
but I may not be able to do anything about it.
